Installing pysiriproxy
================================================================================

The following page contains step by step instructions for installing
pysiriproxy on an Ubuntu system. These instructions have been tested on the
following Ubuntu versions: 10.04, 11.10, and 12.04.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Installing and configuring dnsmasq
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to intercept the commands being sent from the iPhone to Apple's server
you must install a program called *dnsmasq* onto a machine that will be
connected to the same network as the iPhone. The following provides instructions
on properly installing dnsmasq.

Run the following commands::

    $ sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

Now, open the file **/etc/dnsmasq.conf** with the editor of your choice.

Search for **#address=/double-click.net/127.0.0.1** (this should be roughly the
62nd line). Once the line is found, replace that line with the following two
lines::

    address=/guzzoni.apple.com/(your_machine's_ip_address).
    address=/kryten.apple.com/(your_machine's_ip_address).

Be sure to replace your machineâ€™s IP address and then save the file. This will
allow the pysiriproxy server accept connections from devices using either
iOS 5 or iOS 6.

Finally, restart dnsmasq for the new IP address to take effect::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart

.. note:: The above installation sequence was taken from
   `How to install Siri Proxy <http://www.iphonestuffs4u.com/how-to-install-siri-proxy/>`_.

.. note:: Once pysiriproxy has been installed and configured you can follow the
   instructions on :ref:`changing the dnsmasq IP address<changingDnsmasqIp-label>`
   to easily change the IP address used by dnsmasq.
